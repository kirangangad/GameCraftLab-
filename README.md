## 👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m **Kiran Gangad** – a curious coder who believes games are the best way to learn (and sometimes break) programming languages.<br>  
I enjoy experimenting with different tech stacks, mixing logic with creativity, and occasionally battling the mighty bug monster. 🐛⚔️

## 🕹 About This Repository – *GameCraftLab*  
**GameCraftLab** is my personal playground where I build and collect games in different programming languages — from Python to Java, C to JavaScript, and beyond.<br>
Because why settle for being good at one language when you can be *wonderfully average* in many? 😄  
 
**Here you’ll find:**  
- 🕹 Simple console games  
- 🎨 Graphics-based fun projects  
- 🧪 Weird experiments that somehow became games  
- 🛠 Code in multiple languages

💡 *Stay tuned for more games, more chaos, and more creative coding experiments_!* 🚀
